          I'm a young tech enthusiast with a long history of building robots and programming with Python. I've worked on AI projects with Bosch and have explored other technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Linux.
          ---
          My journey started with a few Lego pieces when I was just 4 years old, and since then, I have become the world's youngest certified in Microsoft Powerplatform and Azure AI. I've created over 100 projects using OpenCV, Tensorflow, GPT, and Azure AI. I've also written a research paper on face swapping for autonomous cars, delving deep into the complex issues surrounding privacy and AI bias in autonomous vehicles.`,
